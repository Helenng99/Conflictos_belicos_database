# Conflictos_belicos_database

This project was carried out in December 2022. It was a group project for the Master's program at Assembler Institute of Technology, and the group members were  Lien Chin, Marco Hernani, Jessica LÃ³pez, and Helen Navarro.

For this project, a database on war conflicts was built, which had to contain at least one conflict of the following types: religious, ethnic, territorial, and economic.

The database contained other types of entities and their relationships, in order to later make queries about them.
